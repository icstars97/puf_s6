WARNING:Map:83 - The range defined by columns 27, 27 and rows 48, 77 in area
   group "pblock_mcs_0" does not fall on CLB boundary.  The constraint value
   equals
   SLICE_X0Y32:SLICE_X7Y77,SLICE_X8Y32:SLICE_X13Y63,SLICE_X14Y32:SLICE_X27Y47,SL
   ICE_X27Y48:SLICE_X27Y77,SLICE_X28Y32:SLICE_X53Y39,SLICE_X53Y40:SLICE_X53Y77. 
   This practice is dangerous and will likely lead to overlapping area group
   warnings in PAR as well as possibly undesirable RPM placements.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
